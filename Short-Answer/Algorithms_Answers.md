#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Linear O(n), the definition of a linear O(n) is where the number of steps required are increased or decreased with the number of inputs. This means in this example the number of steps increase as n incraeses. it is linearly increasing. On a graph it would be going up in a diagonal line.


b)Linearithmic ()(n log n)), It takes the input and divides it in half using merge sort. In this example it divides j and n.


c)Linear O(n), requires more steps the more bunnies there are. It increases linearly, as the bunnies increase.

## Exercise II

-grows in proportion to input 
-O(log(n))
-binary search algorithm
-find total height, set midpoint
check to see if midpoint breaks egg
if it does set new height to be bottom half of value set before
-keep on slicing in half above or below midpoint until finding egg doesnt break
-once found set new midpoint to be midpoint of upper half of buildings height that was used previously
-use currently set midpoint to repeat upper or lower half of newly added building height until you find max height
